# About Me

Hi, I'm **Liam Groen**, a student from the Netherlands with a deep interest in **machine learning**, **data science**, and **mathematics**.

I'm currently focused on building a strong foundation in ML by combining theory and practice:  
ðŸ“˜ Reading _Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning_ by Bishop  
ðŸ§ª Working through PyTorch tutorials and hands-on experiments  
ðŸŽ¯ Committing to learn and build *something new every day*

This blog is where I document what I'm learning â€” not only as a study aid, but as a way to share insights and connect with others on a similar journey.

## My Learning Goals

- Build solid understanding of machine learning fundamentals  

- Get hands-on experience with real-world data and models  

- Prepare for internships and a career in applied AI
