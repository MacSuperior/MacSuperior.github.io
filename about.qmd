I am a Dutch student with a passion for learning. 
Machine learning is a topic that I'm interested in, but have only learned the basics of during my studies. That is why I am trying to deepen my knowledge in the subject by reading a lot of books. Currently I am reading the classic *Pattern Recognition and Machine learning*, along with following the PyTorch tutorials, commiting myself to learn something every day!
