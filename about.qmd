I am a Dutch student with a passion for learning. 
Machine learning is a topic that I'm interested in, but have only learned the basics of during my studies. That is why I am trying to deepen my knowledge in the subject by reading a lot of books. Currently I am reading the classic *Pattern Recognition and Machine learning*, along with *Dive Into Deep Learning*. The first is more theory focused, which i enjoy because I like math, and the second has a practical approach to teaching deep learning from scratch.I am currently reading *Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* by Christopher M. Bishop, and *Dive into Deep Learning* by Aston Zhang et al.
