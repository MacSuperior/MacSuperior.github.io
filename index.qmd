# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
Hi, I'm Liam, a student on a journey to understand the world through **machine learning**, **coding**, **data science**, and **mathematics**.

This blog is my digital lab notebook â€” a place where I explain what Iâ€™m learning, work through complex topics, and share insights that might help others learning too.

Whether you're just starting out or deep into the field, I hope you find something useful here.


## ðŸ§  Why I blog

Writing is thinking. By distilling ideas into blog posts, Iâ€™m aiming to:

- Deepen my understanding of technical topics.

- Build a consistent habit of learning and reflection.

- Create a public portfolio of work as I grow in this field.
