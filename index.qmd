It is said that writing about a topic deepens your understanding of that topic, and there is a lot of writing involved with a blog. Additionally, this blog will serve as a good self-motivator to keep steadily learning about my interests. And who knows, maybe people will eventually end up reading it... (Although at the moment of writing I only have one post. Nice!)

That being said, now it is time to dive into my self study and when I learn something new, I will post an update on here. In the meantime, look at this cool picture of the loss landscape of a neural network generated by [Li et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09913), bye!
